Props are a core concept in React because it's how you get data into a component.Props pass data from a parent component down to a child component.\n                You pass props to a component via the component's JXS tag at the place where is used.

When a component has more than one prop, you'll often see them written on separate lines and indented.\n                2. You can omit the value of a prop when it's explicitly true\n                3. Use double quotes (\") when writing props.

This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. )\n\n                    The React docs recommend that we pass a string as the key value. So, to convert the id to string, we can call the toString() method on the player.id.\n\n                    Not all React elements need a key prop.
